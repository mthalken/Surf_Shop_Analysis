# Surf Shop Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to check weather trends in Oahu, Hawaii to help predict the best location for a surf shop and present the results using a Flask app.  

## Project Overview:
1. Using sqlalchemy find the precipitation and tempiture trends for Oahu, Hawaii and specifically a single station.
2. Plot the results using matplotlib using a bar chart in bins.
3. Find the summary statistics for the month of June and December.
4. Using the Flask app report the results.

- Minimum temperatures differ from June at 64 degrees and December at 56 Degrees.
- The total number of measurements also differ from June at 1700 and December at 1517.
- In turn the mean and standard deviation are lower in December.
